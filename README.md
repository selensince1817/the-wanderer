the wanderer is a short 2D indi-quest game with subtle RPG features. 
You 'wake up' in the forest having nothing else to do but start a dialogue with a blue smurf-looking creature. 
During the conversation you find yourself willing to take his quest and help him resolve his family drama.

This is my first project that has taken quite some time. The game is fully written in Java, with the addittion of several core packages that enable the main functionality.
The core packages used here:
  - Swing
  - jbox2d
  - Math
  
I have really enjoyed coming up with and embedding several complex features like realistic combat and enemy behaviour, 
not so much because of its impact on the gameplay but due to the range of various tools I had to use, 
having limited functionality of the engine I was given to work with.

Controls:

  "A" - Move left
  "D" - Move right
  "Space" - Jump
  
  "E" - Interact
  "I" - Open/Close inventory
  "1-9" - Read Item Description
  
  "Left-click" - Attack
